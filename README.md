  **[Placeholder for a GIF: A screen recording shows the user selecting 3 models, typing "What are the pros and cons of nuclear energy?", then watching as the summary card and three response cards populate. The user's cursor hovers over one response card, which smoothly expands to reveal its full text, then retracts.]**

-   **üìä AI-Powered Analysis:** Get an instant, unbiased summary card that analyzes each response. Featuring granular scores out of 100 and star ratings, all generated by Gemini.
